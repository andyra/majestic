The Majestic, in beautiful downtown Abilene, has two large rectangular rooms, a spacious kitchen, and a stage. The standard venue rental is for the North Room, which includes a catering kitchen and restroom. Should you want a little more space, the South Room can be added to your rental package, which includes a stage for your event use.

Though the rooms have been restored and remodeled, the classic charm of the building has been preserved. The original maple floor in the South Room is perfect for dancing. The original dark pine wood floor in the North Room provides a rich, elegant, and comfortable ambiance to compliment your event.

The lighting in both rooms is extremely versatile, with suspended light fixtures and track lighting which highlight the exposed brick of the 100 year-old walls. All lights have dimmers which enable you to provide the look and atmosphere you want. Whether you want a bright, open feel for a daytime meeting or wedding reception or a more softly lit, warm feel for an elegant dinner party, formal dance, or evening event, The Majestic is versatile enough for any occasion.
