  title: Eric Sommer
  date: 2016-02-20
  start: 08:30 PM
  end: 12:00 AM
  description: |
    Mr. Sommer has turned a simple strumming style into what may very well be the next big thing: an explosive and dramatic free-form style and, in the process, he's become one of the finest free-form pickers anywhere, borrowing from Steve Howe, Merle Travis, Doc Watson and turning out a style that is authentically unique. And almost impossible to copy.
    
    But Eric Sommer does more – a wide variety of open tunings, a range of guitars and a collection of small, wonderfully obscure vintage guitar amps add to the presentation. And seeing Mr. Sommer work all these elements in a live show is something audiences remember for years.
    
    With local opener, Taylor Ochs on guitar and ukulele.
